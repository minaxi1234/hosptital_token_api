The hospital uses a token-based system for patient consultations.

Staff members generate tokens by selecting a registered patient and a doctor.
Each token is assigned to a specific doctor.

Tokens are created for the current day and shown in both staff and doctor dashboards.
Tokens are served in the order they are generated.
